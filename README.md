### Description

This is the source code of Assignment 0 - Pong of [CS 50 Introduction to Game Development](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50G+Games/course/). The goal of this assignment was to add AI in the opposing player. The AI would behave based on the ball position and will attempt its best to deflect the ball. The original code without AI update can be found at [games50/pong](https://github.com/games50/pong). The demo of the assignment can be seen at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YNllVSfje4
